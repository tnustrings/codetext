# tangle.py: tangle with chunkname paths
# usage: cat file.nw | python3 tangleb.py
#        cat file.ct | cttonw | python3 tangleb.py

# chunkname paths work like nested directories: for example, if the name <<baz>> appears in the chunk <<bar>>, it's referenced as <<bar/baz>>=
# <<.>>= references the previous codechunk, <<./foo>>= references the <<foo>> tag in the previous codechunk

# if there's only one filename, assume all chunks belong to that filename.

# if there are multiple filenames, they can be aliased: <<program.py: program>>= and then referred to as <<program/codechunk>>=

"""example input (codetext):

to tangle this codetext example, copy it to example.ct and say `cat
example.ct | ./cttonw | python3 tangleb.py`

we open a file foo.py, and alias it as 'foo'.

<<foo.py: foo
   ooh, baby you're a fool to py
   <<bar>>
>>

when we refer to child chunks, we can use the 'foo' alias or the
foo.py filename. if there is only one file in the whole document, and
it doesn't have an alias, leave out its filename when referring to
child chunks. here there is an alias (foo), so we use it to refer to
the bar child:

<<foo/bar
   my bar code
   <<baz>>
>>

a relative path for the baz-child.

<<./baz
   my baz code
>>

this would be baz' absolute path:

<<foo/bar/baz
   and it makes me wonder why
>>

without path we stay in the baz chunk.

<<
   still my baz code.
>>

if there's a loop etc, and we would like the next unnamed chunk in the
text be not to get appended to the chunk end but to be inside the
loop, we can say <<.>>:

<<
   for i = 0; i < n; i++ {
      <<.>>
   }
>>

then the following chunk would appear at the <<.>> tag and not at the
chunk-end.

<<
   inside the loop
>>

go back via ..

<<..
   appending to the foo/bar/baz code again
>>
